          <h1>About</h1>
               <p>My fisrt experience with programming (that I remember) was in third grade. My J-Term project was a LEGO MINDSTORMS robot. In fourth grade I competed in First Lego League, and we won our first battle, but nothing else. In fifth grade the class worked with Scratch and Snap with Finches. We also participated in the Hour of Code. I competed in the 2016 Technovation challenge as a sixth grader but was unfortunately unable to attend the competition itself due to pinkeye. We didn't win anything, unfortunately.</p>
               <p>I want to be an astrophysicist when I get older. According to an actual astrophysicist, that means I'll be coding both observational equipment and super-calculators.</p>
