          <h1>About</h1>
               <p>I was forced to take CS by my parents, but luckily it's more interesting than I expected it to be. I competed in the 2016 Technovation challenge but was unfortunately unable to attend the competition itself due to pinkeye. We didn't win anything, unfortunately.</p>
               <p>I want to be an astrophysicist when I get older. According to an actual astrophysicist, that means I'll be coding both observational equipment and super-calculators (not the actual code, but the inputs-like FORTRAN).</p>
