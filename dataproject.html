          <h1>Data Project</h1>
            <h2>Ice Cream Choices</h2>
              <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>People buying ice cream generally don't know what to look for to get the most actual ice cream in a tub rather than air. Data on labeling requirements and ice cream weights can help people know what to look for.</p>
              <h3>Data Collection and Cleaning</h3>
                <p>For this project, 2 kinds of data were collected: regulations and weights (total, carton, and ice cream). Regulations were researched online from http://www.businessinsider.com/these-are-the-fdas-regulations-on-labeling-ice-cream-2015-7. Weights were found using a common kitchen scale.</p>
                <p>The data was cleaned by placing the weights into a table for side-by-side brand comparison. The regulations were manually sorted for relevance.</p>
              <h3>Decision-Making and Automation</h3>
                <p>The regulations were used to create a general recommendation based on density. This decision was not automated because computers can't read the regulations to find the density each time. Instead, I simply read through to find which label was densest.</p>
                <p>The weights were used to make a specific recommendation within the brands. This decision was partially automated. I entered the total weights (ice cream in the carton) and carton weights, and a simple formula subtracted to find the ice cream weight.</p>
              <h3>Findings</h3>
               <p>All of the ice cream samples were 1 pint (473 ml) in volume.</p>
               <p>“Ice Cream” is defined as having at least 10% dairy milk fat and less than 100% overrun. “Gelato” is defined as generally having less milk fat than the requirement for ice cream but also usually having significantly less overrun.</p>
               <p>“Overrun” is the amount of air mixed in to the product. 100% overrun would be 1/2 air, 1/2 stuff.</p>
               <img src=
               In conclusion, gelato would be the best choice based on density, but not all gelatos are created equal. The gelato brand included in this test, Talenti, actually had the lowest density of all the brands. Ben & Jerry’s is the overall winner, weighing in at 410 grams per pint.
